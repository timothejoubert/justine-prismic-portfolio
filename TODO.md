### TODO

* Check **generated type** 
* Check **Prismic type module** (ex: context.$prismic.api.query())
* Fetch All project page in ProjectListing in getters 
* Tags (all pages or projects) in getters from ProjectsPage getters && AllPage getters 
* Set Page url from UID to slug => (update VNav with slug link and not UID)
* Set default page as Home (if no params go to => fetch uid === 'home-page')
* Set nested route for projectPage
